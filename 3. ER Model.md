#Entity-Relationship (ER) Model Notes

## Understanding the ER Model

### 1. What is the ER Model?

- The **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** is a conceptual modeling approach used to design databases by representing real-world objects and their relationships.
- It provides a visual way to describe the structure of a database using **ER diagrams (ERDs)**.
- The ER model is used during the **conceptual design phase** to create a high-level blueprint before implementing a database in a DBMS.

### Specialization
Specialization is a top-down approach in Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling where a general entity (superclass) is divided into more specific sub-entities (subclasses) based on unique attributes or roles. It's like breaking down a broad category into specialized types.

- **Example:** An "Employee" entity can be specialized into "Full-Time Employee" (with salary) and "Part-Time Employee" (with hourly rate). The subclasses inherit common attributes from the superclass but add their own.
- **Key Features:** Uses "is-a" relationship (e.g., a Full-Time Employee *is an* Employee). Can be total (all superclass instances belong to a subclass) or partial (some don't). Represented by a triangle with "d" for disjoint or "o" for overlapping in ER diagrams.

### Generalization
Generalization is the bottom-up opposite of specialization. It combines multiple specific entities (subclasses) into a single general entity (superclass) by identifying common attributes, abstracting away differences.

- **Example:** "Car," "Truck," and "Motorcycle" entities can be generalized into a "Vehicle" superclass that holds shared attributes like "make" and "model," while specifics (e.g., cargo capacity for Truck) stay in subclasses.
- **Key Features:** Also uses "is-a" hierarchy. Helps reduce redundancy by storing common data once in the superclass. In ER diagrams, it's shown similarly to specialization but focuses on merging.

### Aggregation
Aggregation represents a "whole-part" or "has-a" relationship where a collection of entities is treated as a single higher-level entity. It's used when a relationship between entities needs to be treated as an entity itself for further modeling.

- **Example:** In a project management system, "Team" (whole) aggregates "Employees" (parts). Or, a "Computer" aggregates "CPU," "RAM," and "Hard Drive." If you need to relate the entire "Computer" to a "User," aggregation treats the assembly as one entity.
- **Key Features:** Unlike composition (where parts can't exist without the whole), aggregation allows parts to exist independently. In ER diagrams, it's shown as a diamond inside a box, indicating the aggregated entity can participate in other relationships.

### 2. Components of the ER Model

#### a. Entities

- An **entity** is a real-world object or concept about which data is stored (e.g., Student, Book, Patient).
- Entities are represented as **rectangles** in ERDs.
- **Types**:
  - **Strong Entity**: Has a primary key and does not depend on other entities (e.g., `Student` with `StudentID`).
  - **Weak Entity**: Depends on another entity (its owner) and does not have a unique primary key (e.g., `Dependent` of an `Employee`).

#### b. Attributes

- **Attributes** are properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., `StudentID`, `Name`, `Email` for a `Student`).
- Represented as **ovals** connected to their entity in ERDs.
- **Types**:
  - **Simple**: Cannot be divided (e.g., `Age`).
  - **Composite**: Can be divided into subparts (e.g., `Name` = `FirstName` + `LastName`).
  - **Single-valued**: Has one value per entity (e.g., `StudentID`).
  - **Multi-valued**: Can have multiple values (e.g., `PhoneNumber`, denoted with a double oval).
  - **Derived**: Computed from other attributes (e.g., `Age` derived from `BirthDate`, denoted with a dashed oval).
  - **Key Attribute**: Uniquely identifies an entity (e.g., `StudentID`, underlined in ERDs).

#### c. Relationships

- A **relationship** describes how entities are associated (e.g., a `Student` enrolls in a `Course`).
- Represented as **diamonds** in ERDs, connecting related entities.
- **Types**:
  - **Binary**: Involves two entities (e.g., `Student`–`Course`).
  - **Ternary**: Involves three entities (e.g., `Student`–`Course`–`Professor`).
  - **Recursive**: An entity relates to itself (e.g., `Employee` supervises another `Employee`).

#### d. Cardinality

- **Cardinality** specifies the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity in a relationship.
- Represented by constraints on the edges connecting entities to relationships.
- **Types**:
  - **One-to-One (1:1)**: One instance of entity A relates to exactly one instance of entity B (e.g., `Person`–`Passport`).
  - **One-to-Many (1:N)**: One instance of entity A relates to multiple instances of entity B (e.g., `Department`–`Employee`).
  - **Many-to-One (N:1)**: Multiple instances of entity A relate to one instance of entity B (e.g., `Employee`–`Department`).
  - **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: Multiple instances of entity A relate to multiple instances of entity B (e.g., `Student`–`Course`).
- **Participation Constraints**:
  - **Total Participation**: Every instance of an entity must participate in the relationship (denoted by a double line).
  - **Partial Participation**: Some instances may not participate (denoted by a single line).

### 3. ER Diagram Notations

- **Chen Notation** (commonly used):
  - Entities: Rectangles.
  - Attributes: Ovals (key attributes underlined).
  - Relationships: Diamonds.
  - Cardinality: Labels (e.g., 1:N) or crow’s foot notation.
- **Crow’s Foot Notation**:
  - Uses symbols to indicate cardinality (e.g., a crow’s foot for "many").
  - More compact and widely used in modern tools.

### 4. Tools for Creating ERDs

- **Lucidchart**: A cloud-based diagramming tool with ERD templates and collaboration features.
- **Draw.io (diagrams.net)**: A free, browser-based tool integrated with cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive).
- Both tools support drag-and-drop interfaces to create entities, attributes, and relationships with proper notations.

## ERD Design and Conversion to Relational Schemas

### 1. Steps to Create an ERD

1. **Identify Entities**: List the main objects in the system (e.g., for a hospital: `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`).
2. **Define Attributes**: Assign properties to each entity, including key attributes.
3. **Determine Relationships**: Identify how entities are related and specify cardinality.
4. **Add Constraints**: Include primary keys, foreign keys, and participation constraints.
5. **Draw the ERD**: Use a tool to visually represent the model, ensuring clarity and correctness.
6. **Validate**: Check that the ERD meets the system’s requirements and supports all necessary operations.

### 2. Practice: ERDs for Sample Systems

Below are ERDs for a **hospital** and **library** system, designed using Chen notation for clarity.

#### a. Hospital System ERD

**Entities and Attributes**:

- **Patient**:
  - `PatientID` (key, unique)
  - `Name` (composite: `FirstName`, `LastName`)
  - `DOB` (Date of Birth)
  - `Phone` (multi-valued)
- **Doctor**:
  - `DoctorID` (key, unique)
  - `Name` (composite: `FirstName`, `LastName`)
  - `Specialty`
- **Appointment**:
  - `AppointmentID` (key, unique)
  - `Date`
  - `Time`
  - `Diagnosis` (derived from visit outcome)

**Relationships**:

- `Patient`–`Makes`–`Appointment`: A patient can have multiple appointments (1:N).
- `Doctor`–`Attends`–`Appointment`: A doctor can attend multiple appointments, but each appointment has one doctor (1:N).

**Cardinality**:

- `Patient` to `Appointment`: 1:N (one patient can have many appointments).
- `Doctor` to `Appointment`: 1:N (one doctor can have many appointments).
- **Total Participation**: Every `Appointment` must involve one `Patient` and one `Doctor`.

**Text-Based ERD** (Chen Notation Approximation):

```
[Patient] --(Makes)--> [Appointment] <--(Attends)-- [Doctor]
   |                        |                        |
   | PatientID (PK)        | AppointmentID (PK)     | DoctorID (PK)
   | Name                  | Date                   | Name
   | DOB                   | Time                   | Specialty
   | Phone (multi-valued)  | Diagnosis (derived)
```

#### b. Library System ERD

**Entities and Attributes**:

- **Book**:
  - `ISBN` (key, unique)
  - `Title`
  - `Author`
  - `PublicationYear`
- **Member**:
  - `MemberID` (key, unique)
  - `Name` (composite: `FirstName`, `LastName`)
  - `Email`
- **Loan**:
  - `LoanID` (key, unique)
  - `BorrowDate`
  - `ReturnDate`
  - `Fine` (derived, based on overdue days)

**Relationships**:

- `Member`–`Borrows`–`Loan`: A member can have multiple loans (1:N).
- `Book`–`InvolvedIn`–`Loan`: A book can be part of multiple loans (1:N).

**Cardinality**:

- `Member` to `Loan`: 1:N (one member can have many loans).
- `Book` to `Loan`: 1:N (one book can be borrowed in many loans).
- **Partial Participation**: A `Member` or `Book` may not be involved in any `Loan`.

**Text-Based ERD** (Chen Notation Approximation):

```
[Member] --(Borrows)--> [Loan] <--(InvolvedIn)-- [Book]
   |                        |                        |
   | MemberID (PK)         | LoanID (PK)            | ISBN (PK)
   | Name                  | BorrowDate             | Title
   | Email                 | ReturnDate             | Author
                           | Fine (derived)         | PublicationYear
```

### 3. Converting ERDs to Relational Schemas

To convert an ERD to a **relational schema**, follow these steps:

1. **Map Strong Entities**:
   - Create a table for each strong entity.
   - Include all attributes, with the key attribute as the primary key.
2. **Map Weak Entities**:
   - Create a table with attributes and include the primary key of the owner entity as a foreign key.
   - The primary key is a composite of the weak entity’s partial key and the owner’s primary key.
3. **Map Relationships**:
   - **1:1 or 1:N Relationships**: Add a foreign key in the table on the “many” side referencing the “one” side’s primary key.
   - **M:N Relationships**: Create a separate table with foreign keys referencing both entities’ primary keys. The combination of foreign keys forms the primary key.
4. **Map Multi-valued Attributes**:
   - Create a separate table with the entity’s primary key and the multi-valued attribute.
5. **Map Composite Attributes**:
   - Include each component as a separate column in the entity’s table.
6. **Map Derived Attributes**:
   - Typically not stored in the schema but computed when needed.

#### a. Hospital System Relational Schema

**Tables**:

- `Patient`:
  - `PatientID` (Primary Key, Integer)
  - `FirstName` (Varchar)
  - `LastName` (Varchar)
  - `DOB` (Date)
- `PatientPhone` (for multi-valued `Phone`):
  - `PatientID` (Foreign Key referencing `Patient`, Integer)
  - `Phone` (Varchar)
  - Primary Key: (`PatientID`, `Phone`)
- `Doctor`:
  - `DoctorID` (Primary Key, Integer)
  - `FirstName` (Varchar)
  - `LastName` (Varchar)
  - `Specialty` (Varchar)
- `Appointment`:
  - `AppointmentID` (Primary Key, Integer)
  - `PatientID` (Foreign Key referencing `Patient`, Integer)
  - `DoctorID` (Foreign Key referencing `Doctor`, Integer)
  - `Date` (Date)
  - `Time` (Time)
  - (`Diagnosis` is derived, not stored)

**Explanation**:

- `Patient` and `Doctor` are strong entities, mapped directly to tables.
- `Phone` (multi-valued) requires a separate `PatientPhone` table.
- `Makes` and `Attends` (1:N) are represented by foreign keys `PatientID` and `DoctorID` in `Appointment`.

#### b. Library System Relational Schema

**Tables**:

- `Book`:
  - `ISBN` (Primary Key, Varchar)
  - `Title` (Varchar)
  - `Author` (Varchar)
  - `PublicationYear` (Integer)
- `Member`:
  - `MemberID` (Primary Key, Integer)
  - `FirstName` (Varchar)
  - `LastName` (Varchar)
  - `Email` (Varchar)
- `Loan`:
  - `LoanID` (Primary Key, Integer)
  - `MemberID` (Foreign Key referencing `Member`, Integer)
  - `ISBN` (Foreign Key referencing `Book`, Varchar)
  - `BorrowDate` (Date)
  - `ReturnDate` (Date)
  - (`Fine` is derived, not stored)

**Explanation**:

- `Book` and `Member` are strong entities, mapped to tables.
- `Loan` represents the M:N relationship between `Member` and `Book`, so it includes foreign keys `MemberID` and `ISBN`.
- No multi-valued or composite attributes require additional tables.

### 4. Additional Practice: E-Commerce System ERD

To reinforce learning, let’s design an ERD for an e-commerce system (as an extra example).

**Entities and Attributes**:

- **Customer**:
  - `CustomerID` (key, unique)
  - `Name` (composite: `FirstName`, `LastName`)
  - `Email`
- **Product**:
  - `ProductID` (key, unique)
  - `Name`
  - `Price`
- **Order**:
  - `OrderID` (key, unique)
  - `OrderDate`
  - `TotalAmount` (derived)

**Relationships**:

- `Customer`–`Places`–`Order`: A customer can place multiple orders (1:N).
- `Order`–`Contains`–`Product`: An order can contain multiple products, and a product can be in multiple orders (M:N).

**Cardinality**:

- `Customer` to `Order`: 1:N.
- `Order` to `Product`: M:N (requires a separate table for the relationship).

**Text-Based ERD**:

```
[Customer] --(Places)--> [Order] --(Contains)--> [Product]
   |                        |                        |
   | CustomerID (PK)       | OrderID (PK)           | ProductID (PK)
   | Name                  | OrderDate              | Name
   | Email                 | TotalAmount (derived)  | Price
```

**Relational Schema**:

- `Customer`:
  - `CustomerID` (Primary Key, Integer)
  - `FirstName` (Varchar)
  - `LastName` (Varchar)
  - `Email` (Varchar)
- `Product`:
  - `ProductID` (Primary Key, Integer)
  - `Name` (Varchar)
  - `Price` (Decimal)
- `Order`:
  - `OrderID` (Primary Key, Integer)
  - `CustomerID` (Foreign Key referencing `Customer`, Integer)
  - `OrderDate` (Date)
- `OrderDetail` (for M:N `Contains` relationship):
  - `OrderID` (Foreign Key referencing `Order`, Integer)
  - `ProductID` (Foreign Key referencing `Product`, Integer)
  - `Quantity` (Integer)
  - Primary Key: (`OrderID`, `ProductID`)
